title: SimpleScreenRecorder (UNOFFICIAL)
summary: A feature-rich screen recorder
description: |
  SimpleScreenRecorder is a feature-rich screen recorder that supports
  X11 and OpenGL. It has a Qt-based graphical user interface. It can
  record the entire screen or part of it, or record OpenGL applications
  directly(currently not supported in snap distribution). The recording
  can be paused and resumed at any time. Many different file formats and
  codecs are supported.

  **Key features**

  * Synchronizes audio and video properly.
  * Reduces the video frame rate if your computer is too slow.
  * Fully multithreaded: small delays in any of the components will
    never block the other components, resulting is smoother video and
    better performance on computers with multiple processors.
  * Can also do live streaming (experimental).

  **Known issues**

  Currently OpenGL recording is not supported by this build due to the
  confinement and library separation nature of snap apps.

  **Disclaimer**

  This is NOT an official SimpleScreenRecorder distribution, refer [the
  snap's issue tracker](https://github.com/Lin-Buo-Ren/simplescreenrecorder-snap/issues)
  for support.
